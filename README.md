# The-Football-Coach
This is a project I created in assembly 8086. This was one of my very first projects and one of the biggest ones I have done.\
I have been a fan of american football for a long time and this is my take on a coach/guide to helping you get some of the basic knowledge and skills needded.\
This game/GUI includes two options: learn or quiz yourself. Plus 3 different modes(QB, WR and RB).
Goals for the future of this project:

         1. Make the code neater (right now it is pretty messy and not so efficient)
         2. Add some more documentation
         3. Make more routes 
         4. Add the ability to create your own routes by yourself
## To Run: ##
I used the DOSBOX emulator which you can get in [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/dosbox/0.74/DOSBox0.74-win32-installer.exe/download?use_mirror=netix&r=&use_mirror=netix "Named link title")\
To compile my code I used TASM assembler. Then I ran a TLINK.\
However if you just want to run my game you can download the exe file and run it in the DOSBOX emulator.

I hope you enjoy this project, and if you have and suggestions please let me know!
