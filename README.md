# The-Football-Coach
This is a project I created in assembly 8086. This was one of my very first projects and one of the biggest ones I have done.\
I have been a fan of american football for a long time and this is my take on a coach/guide to helping you get some of the basic knowledge and skills needded.\
This game/GUI includes two options: learn or quiz yourself. Plus 3 different modes(QB, WR and RB).
Goals for the future of this project:\
Markup : 1. Make the code neater (right now it is pretty messy and not so efficient)\
         2. Add some more documentation\
         3. Make more routes \
         4. Add the ability to create your own routes by yourself\
